* Areas for developing greater strength
  * Brady - knowledge of content, technical excellence, teamwork
  * Cody - better modularization

Approach to day-to-day development - if a team member feels lost or behind, the other team member will help them to understand what is being done and why before and during development of a particular feature

### Conflict resolution

* If one team member is pulling all the weight: that team member will let the other know they feel as is if the other is not contributing as much and they need help, for the good of the team

* If one person is taking over: the other person will let them know they feel like they are not contributing as much and they would like to pull their own weight on the team

* Collaborating on an app with differing skill levels: team members will ask others if they understand what is going on, and if not offer to explain the concept deeper so that both members are on the same page with what is going on
